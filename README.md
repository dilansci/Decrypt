# About the Game
The contents of this repo have the **"Randomiser"** for the game **'Decrypt'**, which is a passion project for the game **"Inscryption"** by **Daniel Mullins**. 

More info on the game itself can be found in the **"DecryptRules.txt"** document. 

Currently this project is still underway, but I will hopefully have updates coming in the near future ðŸ˜Š. (maybe some actual UI...)
